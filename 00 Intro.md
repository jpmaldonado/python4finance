## How this will go?:
- Lots of coding! Follow along, programming is best done by **doing**. 
	- All code is available, **but** is better if you do it yourself and write your own comments/notes/etc as we go!

## Why Python?
- Zero license fees/vendor lock-in.
- General purpose language, which means faster integration of prototypes with the real world.
- Thanks to popularity, many libraries available for common tasks.
- Relatively simple for beginners, compared to other production-level alternatives (C++, Java).
